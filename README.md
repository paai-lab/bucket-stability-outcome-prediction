# Assessing the quality of outcome-based business process predictive monitoring models
This repository handles the codes for the paper titled "Assessing the quality of outcome-based business process predictive monitoring models". The experiments use the approach proposed in "https://github.com/irhete/predictive-monitoring-benchmark" by Teinemaa et al. (2019). Then, this paper uses stability_calculator.py to calculate three quality metrics as in below:

#### Overall bucket performance (OBP)
#### Intra-bucket prediction stability (IBS)
#### Cross-bucket performance stability (XBS)
